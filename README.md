# Repo for 48Key keyboard build

This keyboard can be printed on a 3D printer using the files in the repo.

Give credit to [Luke-Schutt](https://github.com/luke-schutt/keyboards/tree/main/48keys) who designed the keyboard.
The base was modified to give the keyboard some extra height and clearance for the Cherry MX style switchs.

Used M2.5-6 bolts and nuts to connect the base and the case together.

Printed on SOVOL SV06+

Settings:
- .2 mm layer height
- 3 perimeters
- 20% infill Concentric with Monotonic top fill
- Ironing enabled
